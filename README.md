# Prediction-of-Parkinson-Disease-from-Gut-Microbial-Data

## This is ongoing research project for my current degree. I have just released the first draft of my thesis, a report showing the main methods and result.

## The dataset is from: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/PRJEB14674 
QIIME1 commands based on Linux operating system for preprocessing this RNA sequencing dataset have been posted. 
## Main Codes of machine learning predictive models are in 'Codes for ML model'. 
Main codes are a little messy. 
I'm arranging and organizing them. They will be understandable and readable later.
